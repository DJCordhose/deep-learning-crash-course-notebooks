# Companion notebooks for the code samples of the video course "Deep Learning Crash Course"

This repository contains notebooks implementing the code samples found in the video course [Deep Learning Crash Course (Manning Publications)](https://www.manning.com/livevideo/deep-learning-crash-course?a_aid=djcordhose&a_bid=e8e77cbf). Note that the video course features far more content than you will find in these notebooks, in particular further explanations and figures. Here we have only included the code samples themselves and immediately related surrounding comments.

These notebooks have been created using Python 3.6 and TensorFlow 1.11

## TensorFlow 2

TensorFlow models from Unit 3 converted to TensorFlow 2

_Caution: TensorFlow 2.0 is still not final and on Colab it does not support GPU, yet. Training on CPU might take quite some time._
